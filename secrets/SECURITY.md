# Spectra Security Guidelines

## Secret Management

All secrets and credentials should be managed using environment variables and never committed to the repository.

## Environment Variable Handling

1. Use the provided `.env.template` file as a guide for creating environment-specific files.
2. Store actual environment files locally or in a secure secret management system.
3. Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflow variables.

## Access Control

1. Follow the principle of least privilege for all service accounts.
2. Regularly rotate credentials and access tokens.
3. Review access permissions quarterly.

## Docker Security

1. Use specific version tags for base images, not `latest`.
2. Run containers as non-root users.
3. Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Network Security

1. Restrict network access to services.
2. Use HTTPS for all external communications.
3. Implement proper firewall rules.

## Compliance Requirements

Ensure all deployments meet the following requirements:
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Regular security audits
- Proper logging for audit trails

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:
1. Immediately isolate the affected systems
2. Document the incident and response actions
3. Follow the detailed incident response plan
