Getting Started
Clone and setup environment (see instructions.md).

Ensure CLI tools are installed and configured.

Use provided AI prompts and MCP profiles to maintain consistency.

Validate all infrastructure changes with linters and tests.

Collaboration Workflow
Review Strategist AI’s daily infrastructure roadmap.

Work with Engineer AI for scripting, automation, and security compliance.

Conduct code and config reviews focused on reliability and security.

Keep documentation and runbooks updated for all infrastructure components.

AI Interaction Guidelines
Use prompt.md and mcp.md files to tailor AI assistance per task.

Inject clear daily mission briefs for best AI performance.

Verify AI suggestions against live infrastructure state.

Treat AI as partners to augment human expertise.

Version Control and Documentation
Commit frequently with descriptive messages.

Update documentation alongside code and configs.
